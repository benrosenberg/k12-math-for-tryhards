|-|----|----|
| k  | classification of groups of objects, ordering of objects by size or quantity, sorting, numerals 0-10 (and creation of custom numerals), counting with groups (sequences), comparison of quantities specified by numerals, shapes (straight and curved lines, corners/vertices, sides, 2-d shapes, 3-d shapes), addition, subtraction, understanding numeral bases (e.g., 10) | set theory, well-ordered sets, sorting algorithms, number theory (peano arithmetic and natural numbers with succ and 0, etc.), sequences/series, definition of n-gons and planes and lines, 2- and 3-space, addition and subtraction defined inductively on natural numbers, numerical bases |
| 1  | comparing numbers using place value, partitioning sets (e.g., fourths, halves, etc.), telling time | implications of numerical bases, partitioning sets using equivalence classes, modular arithmetic (clock arithmetic) and beginning number theory |
| 2  | measurement of quantities (e.g., length) with various units, solving problems with money, creating and identifying 2- and 3-d shapes (and pieceing together the shapes from constituent pieces), modeling equal shares of shapes | type theory (units) and type checking, finance, methods of creation of equal pieces of shapes by way of [tiling](http://www.michaelbeeson.com/research/papers/TriangleTiling1.pdf)  |
| 3  | multiplication and division, area and perimeter, fractions | definition of multiplication as repeated addition (again using natural numbers), definition of division in the number-theoretical sense, discussion of rational, real, and irrational numbers and their closures under various operators (foray into group theory), calculation of area using integrals, and calculation of perimeter using line integrals |
| 4  | factoring, conversion of fractions to decimals, perpendicular lines, symmetry in polygons, understanding of angles (complementary, supplementary) | factorization of numbers (prime factorization uniqueness), conversion of bases and decimal base definitions (floating point arithmetic with mantissas etc.), angles and perpendicularity (trigonometry, linear algebra -- dot and cross products and perpendicularity) |
